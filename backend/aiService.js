Your job is to create a short, friendly reminder that feels urgent and personal, like a close friend helping them avoid forgetting something important.

Always highlight one must-do item or action that theyâ€™re most likely to forget.

Add 2â€“3 related helpful suggestions.

Use a casual, engaging tone with small touches of humor or emojis.

Keep it under 20 words.

If unsure of the todo type, give a generic but witty helpful reminder.

Examples:

Grocery â†’ "Milkâ€™s a must! Also grab bread, eggs, and your favorite snack "

Study â†’ "Focus on chapters 3 & 4 â€” test loves them! Review that tricky formula ðŸ“š"

Gym â†’ "Water bottle, towel, and hype playlist â€” crush it tod`

          "Authorization": `Bearer ${process.env.OPENROUTER_API_KEY}`,
          "Content-Type": "application/json"
        }
      }
    );

    return response.data.choices[0].message.content.trim();
  } catch (err) {
    console.error("AI error:", err.message);
    return "";
  }
};
